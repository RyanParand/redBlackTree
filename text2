Introduction
This project involves the implementation of a Red-Black Tree (RBT) data structure, including insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal operations. Additionally, it includes a performance analysis of the RBT, comparing it to other tree structures such as AVL trees and regular binary search trees (BSTs). The project also provides visualization tools for better understanding the tree structure.

Red-Black Tree Overview
A Red-Black Tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Each node stores an additional bit that represents "color" (either red or black). The tree maintains balance by enforcing the following properties:

Node Color: Every node is either red or black.
Root Property: The root of the tree is always black.
Leaf Property: Every leaf (NIL node) is black.
Red Property: If a node is red, then both its children must be black (i.e., no two red nodes can be adjacent).
Depth Property: Every path from a node to its descendant NIL nodes must have the same number of black nodes.
These properties ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced, resulting in logarithmic height relative to the number of nodes.

Algorithms and Their Running Times
Insertion
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Insertion involves placing the new node in the correct position as in a regular BST, followed by re-coloring and rotations to maintain Red-Black properties.

Deletion
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Deletion is more complex as it requires fixing up the tree to ensure Red-Black properties are maintained, often involving multiple rotations and re-coloring.

Searching
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
Searching follows the standard BST search operation, benefiting from the balanced nature of the tree.

Traversal
In-Order Traversal: O(n)
Traversal operations such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order visit each node once.

Usage of Red-Black Trees
Red-Black Trees are widely used in computer science for:

Implementing associative arrays and sets: Many standard libraries (e.g., C++ STL's map and set) use Red-Black Trees.
Database indexing: Red-Black Trees provide balanced search times, making them suitable for database indices.
Real-time applications: Their consistent performance characteristics make them ideal for systems requiring predictable operation times.
Implementation Details
Node Class
The Node class is the fundamental building block of the Red-Black Tree. Each node stores:

Key: The value of the node.
Color: The color of the node (red or black).
Left Child: Reference to the left child node.
Right Child: Reference to the right child node.
Parent: Reference to the parent node.
Red-Black Tree Class
The Red-Black Tree class manages the overall structure and operations of the tree, ensuring that all Red-Black properties are maintained. It includes methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

Insertion
Insertion in a Red-Black Tree involves the following steps:

BST Insertion: Insert the new node as you would in a regular binary search tree.
Coloring: Set the new node's color to red.
Fix-Up: Call a fix-up method to restore Red-Black properties, which may involve re-coloring and performing rotations.
Rotations
Rotations are key to maintaining the Red-Black Tree properties. They help in re-balancing the tree:

Left Rotation: Moves a node down and its right child up to the left.
Right Rotation: Moves a node down and its left child up to the right.
These operations are used during insertion and deletion to ensure the tree remains balanced.

Fix-Up Operations
Fix-up operations are performed after insertion to maintain the Red-Black properties. The typical fix-up process involves:

Re-Coloring: Adjusting the colors of the nodes.
Rotations: Performing left or right rotations to fix any violations of the Red-Black properties.
The goal is to ensure that no two red nodes are adjacent and that the tree remains balanced.

Searching
Searching in a Red-Black Tree is identical to searching in a regular binary search tree. You start at the root and move left or right depending on the comparison of the key with the current node's key.

Traversal
Traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) visit each node in the tree. In-order traversal visits nodes in ascending order, pre-order visits nodes before their children, and post-order visits nodes after their children.

File Descriptions

Purpose
The red_black_tree.py file contains the core implementation of the Red-Black Tree data structure. It defines the Node class and the RedBlackTree class, along with all necessary methods to maintain the Red-Black properties.
